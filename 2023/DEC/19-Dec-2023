AWS Event Bridge

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
It simplifies the building of event-driven applications by allowing you to connect different AWS services, integrated software as a service (SaaS) applications, and your own custom applications using events. 
These events can be easily routed to one or more targets, such as AWS Lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues etc;

Key features of AWS EventBridge include:

1.Event Bus: An event bus is a communication channel for different components to communicate with each other. 
AWS provides a default event bus for your account, but you can also create custom event buses.

2.Events: Events are messages that indicate a change in your environment. They are produced by event sources. 
For example, changes to an AWS resource can trigger events, and EventBridge can route these events to targets for processing.

3.Event Sources: These are entities or services that produce events. 
Common examples include AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch, as well as custom applications.

4.Rules: Rules define the criteria for matching incoming events and specify which targets should receive the events. 
You can create rules to filter events based on event attributes.

5.Targets: Targets are the endpoint components that process events.
AWS EventBridge supports various target types, including AWS Lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues, Kinesis Data Streams, and more.


Here's a simple workflow of how AWS EventBridge operates:
. An event source generates an event when a change occurs (e.g., an S3 bucket gets a new file).
. The event is sent to the default or a custom event bus.
. Rules are used to match and filter events.
. Matched events are sent to the specified targets for further processing.
