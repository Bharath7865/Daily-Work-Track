Revision on Elastic BeanStalk.

Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web apps & services.
Upload your code and EB automatically handles the deployment like auto-scaling, capacity provisioning, load balancing & health monitoring.
EB supports multiple programing languages like PHP, .Net, Python, Ruby etc;
There is no charge for EB, but we need to pay for AWS resources which are launched from EB.
